<q>And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good.</q> - John Steinbeck
<blockquote>
    "It is impossible to live without failing at something,
    unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case,
    you fail by default." â€” J.K. Rowling
